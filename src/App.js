                <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
                <p>
                  Hi! I'm Steven Lo, a Chinese Costa Rican Computer Science student at NYU Tandon minoring in Mathematics, Cybersecurity, and Game Engineering. I previously worked as a Systems Development Engineer Intern at Amazon, where I integrated AI-powered forecasting tools and deployed scalable AWS pipelines.
                  Currently, I'm an IT Student Worker at NYU, providing technical support and improving system efficiency for faculty and staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm passionate about combining innovation with practical solutions and have a strong interest in AI, Data Science, Game Design, and Software Engineering.
                  My ultimate goal is to build a career at the intersection of these fields, creating technology that makes a real impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, cooking, biking, running, and exploring new places. I love trying different cuisines, spending time in nature, and discovering unique cultural experiences.
                </p>

                  I was born and raised in San José, Costa Rica, as the child of Chinese immigrants. 
                  Growing up in such a vibrant and welcoming environment shaped my outlook on life and taught me the importance of staying positive and open-minded.

                  Surrounded by Costa Rica's rich biodiversity — from rainforests to beaches — I developed a deep appreciation for nature, sustainability, and environmental care.

                <p className="lead">
                  Moving to New York City to study at NYU Tandon has been one of the most transformative chapters of my life. Living in Brooklyn introduced me to a fast-paced, diverse, and dynamic environment that continuously challenges me to grow both academically and personally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Adjusting to life in the city took time. Learning how to navigate the subway, balance a demanding course load, and manage work and extracurricular commitments taught me the importance of resilience, independence, and time management.
                  Through these experiences, I became more confident and adaptable, qualities that continue to guide me both inside and outside the classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I settled into city life, I also discovered a love for exploring New York's incredible food scene. I started using <strong>Beli</strong> to track my favorite restaurants, hidden gems, and new cuisines.
                  It's been a fun and rewarding way to connect with the city and its diverse cultures through food.
                </p>
                <p>
                The city's thriving tech ecosystem and cultural richness have broadened my perspective and deepened my passion for computer science and innovation.
                New York has shaped not only my academic journey but also how I appreciate creativity, community, and the little experiences that make life meaningful.

                <p className="lead">
                  My time in Austin, Texas was my first experience living in the state, and it became one of the most meaningful chapters of my life. I lived near the University of Texas at Austin campus, which allowed me to experience both the academic atmosphere and the city’s lively culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Living in Austin introduced me to the city’s thriving tech scene, from innovative startups to major companies. This exposure helped me better understand what I want to pursue in computer science and how technology can impact people’s everyday lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Outside of work, I enjoyed exploring Austin’s food scene. Terry Black’s BBQ and Cabo Bob’s quickly became two of my favorite spots. I also started running more frequently and used <strong>Strava</strong> to track my routes. Some of my best runs were along Lady Bird Lake at sunset and across the Congress Avenue Bridge, where I often stopped to watch the bats fly out in the evenings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Austin taught me to stay curious, be active, and appreciate every experience along the way.

                  In Fall 2024, I studied away at NYU Shanghai, where I reconnected with my family roots and immersed myself in Chinese language and culture. I practiced Mandarin, learned to navigate daily life with apps like WeChat, Alipay, and Meituan, and enjoyed local favorites such as HeyTea, Chagee, Molly Tea, and Haidilao Hotpot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Traveling on the Gaotie high-speed rail, I explored cities including Shanghai, Chongqing, Beijing, Chengdu, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Macau, Xi'an, and Nanjing, as well as the stunning landscapes of Zhangjiajie and Huangshan. Visiting landmarks like the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and the Terracotta Warriors, and celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival with friends, made the experience unforgettable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My time in China strengthened my connection to my heritage and gave me a deeper appreciation for how culture, language, and people shape the way we see the world.
